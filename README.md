KLM analysis, also known as Keystroke-Level Modeling, is a technique used to estimate the time it takes for a user to complete a task on a computer system. It breaks down the task into individual actions, such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and mental operations, and assigns time values to each action. By summing up these time values, the total time required to complete the task can be estimated. KLM analysis is often used in human-computer interaction research and user interface design to evaluate and optimize the efficiency of user interactions. It provides valuable insights into the cognitive and physical demands of a task, helping designers make informed decisions to improve user experience.

The goal of this project is to design and develop a tools that makes easier for HCI engineer to analyse interfaces using this method.
